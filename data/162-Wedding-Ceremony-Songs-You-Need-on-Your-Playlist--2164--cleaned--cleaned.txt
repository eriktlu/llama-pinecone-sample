You're busy putting together your perfect ceremony—you've booked the location, found an officiant and even written your vows (bonus points for that). But don't lose steam when it comes time to choose your wedding ceremony songs. The songs you choose will set the tone, not only for your ceremony, but for your whole day. Whether you love rock or would rather walk down the aisle hearing Lady Gaga's iconic vocals, we're here to help you choose the best wedding ceremony songs for your day. Check out our list of wedding songs for ceremonies, plus tips on how to select your tunes.
How many songs do you need for a wedding ceremony?
You should pick at least five songs for your wedding ceremony. One for the processional, three for any moments in between and one for the recessional. Your song amount will depend on your ceremony schedule, but there are no hard and fast rules to how many songs you can have on your playlist. By having at least five songs, you ensure there's no awkward or dead silence.
How do you choose wedding ceremony songs?
The music you choose for your wedding ceremony sets the tone. You can choose your wedding ceremony songs based on three factors: The venue, the type of ceremony it is and the wedding theme. First, keep in mind that some venues, like churches, have strict guidelines on what songs are played, so that will impact your song choice. Plus, the size of your venue will determine if you can have a live band perform or have to enlist someone to play the songs over a speaker system. So take note of your venue's rules and size before choosing your ceremony songs. Second, the type of ceremony or wedding ceremony order, like traditional, Jewish, Catholic and much more, have varying ceremony order outlines. So pick songs that fit into your ceremony schedule. The last thing to consider is your wedding theme. If you're planning a country wedding, pick a list of your favorite country tunes. If you're having a casual affair, play "Teenage Dream," by Katy Perry, during the recessional. No matter how you choose your songs, make sure you stay true to what you and your partner would love to hear, not what's traditional.
