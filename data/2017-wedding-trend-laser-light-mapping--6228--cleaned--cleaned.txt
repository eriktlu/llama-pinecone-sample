2017 wedding trend: laser light mapping
Have a big venue but no idea where to start with decorations? What if you could decorate your entire space with just one decoration? You can, which is why more and more couples are choosing to decorate…with light.
We’ve seen laser light projections on cakes, but projection surface space is growing. Instead of just a moving design on a wedding cake or small surface, light is being used to project patterns, designs and solid colors onto walls and all over venues. Laser light mapping gives people the ability to fill an entire room with colorful designs, silhouettes and custom images.
Lighting is a popular tactic for decorating the floor at venues, but it can be used to decorate walls, tables and even people! Why just decorate your space when you can decorate your guests? This floral light show from creative design group Team Lab is created in real time meaning it interacts individually with guests and their movement. Not only can light mapping set the tone for your venue, it can also provide entertainment for your guests!
