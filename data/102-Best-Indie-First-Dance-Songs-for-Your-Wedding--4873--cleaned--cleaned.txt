If you're looking for the best indie songs to round out your wedding day playlist, you're in luck. We've curated a mix of 102 indie and alternative tunes to walk down the aisle to or get your guests pumped up for a night of dancing and celebrating. With sweet Ingrid Michaelson tunes and swoon-worthy Bon Iver wedding songs, this indie playlist reads more like a backyard bash than a formal ceremony but will still have your friends and family on the dance floor all night.
Daniela Andrade's acoustic version of Beyoncé's "Crazy in Love" and Jack Johnson's live version of "Angel/Better Together" make the sweetest indie first dance songs. And we think the best way to signal a dance-off is with Haim's "The Wire" because no one can resist that guitar opener, right? Next, get couples paired up to the utterly romantic "Sweeter" by Awake or Sleeping and "You and I" by Ingrid Michaelson. Finally, whether your send-off is through a sea of waving sparklers or riding off in a getaway car, make a grand exit to an epic closer like "The General Specific" by Band of Horses or "My Body" by Young the Giant.
